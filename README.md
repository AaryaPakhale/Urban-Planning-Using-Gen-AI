###City Planning Suggestions using Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Google Maps
This project uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate sustainable and budget-conscious city planning suggestions based on location-specific maps retrieved from Google Maps. The model analyzes regional maps and outputs both text suggestions and a modified map image highlighting the areas where suggested changes should be implemented.

#File Descriptions

app.py: This file sets up a Streamlit-based web application for the frontend, allowing users to input a location and get city planning suggestions. It interacts with the VLM and displays the output text and the highlighted image.

vlm.py: Contains the Vision-Language Model (VLM), which processes location-specific maps and provides planning suggestions. It outputs the suggestions as text and identifies key pixel coordinates for marking the map.

google_maps.py: Handles Google Maps API requests to retrieve satellite or regional map images based on the provided location. The image is saved and passed to the VLM for further processing.

highlight_pixels.py: A utility function that highlights specific areas of the map image based on coordinates provided by the VLM. It draws circles on the image to indicate important locations.

pipeline.py: Combines the entire workflow. It takes a location and prompt from the user, retrieves the map image, processes it through the VLM, and highlights areas on the map based on the suggestions. It returns both the planning suggestions and the highlighted image.

#Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/city-planning-vlm.git
cd city-planning-vlm
2. Install Required Packages
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Google Maps API
To retrieve maps based on location, you’ll need a Google Maps API key.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing one.
Enable the Maps Static API and get your API key.
Replace the placeholder in google_maps.py with your API key.
python
Copy code
# google_maps.py
API_KEY = 'your-google-maps-api-key-here'
4. Running the Application
Frontend (Streamlit)
To start the Streamlit app, run:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will launch a web interface where you can input a location and receive planning suggestions along with the highlighted map.

Direct Execution via Pipeline
Alternatively, you can run the entire process from the command line using the pipeline:

bash
Copy code
python pipeline.py
This will retrieve the map, process it through the VLM, and save the suggestions and highlighted map image locally.

5. Example Usage
Input:
Location: Mumbai, India
Prompt: "This area faces issues with hospital availability."
Output:
Text Suggestions:

Construct new hospitals in the eastern region.
Improve transportation access to existing facilities.
Allocate budget for healthcare infrastructure in the northern zones.
Highlighted Map: The areas where hospitals should be constructed and transportation improved will be marked with red circles.

Technical Details
Vision-Language Model (VLM):

The VLM processes the map and prompt to generate city planning suggestions.
It also identifies key pixel coordinates on the map for visual highlighting.
Google Maps API:

Fetches the map image based on the user-provided location, which serves as input to the VLM.
OpenCV for Image Highlighting:

OpenCV is used to draw circles around key areas on the map image based on the coordinates provided by the VLM.
Customization
Modifying the VLM:
You can fine-tune the VLM by modifying the prompt.txt file or adjusting the model parameters in vlm.py. This can allow the model to focus on different aspects of urban planning or adapt it to different regions.

Changing the Highlight Color or Radius:
You can customize the color and radius of the highlighted areas in highlight_pixels.py by adjusting the default parameters of the highlight_pixels function.

python
Copy code
highlighted_image = highlight_pixels(image, coordinates, highlight_color=(0, 255, 0), radius=100)
